Aurora Audibilis
======

An audio visualizer designed for dome projection.

This app was created for "Nature of Code, Cosmos Edition," a two week course at ITP / NYU. We were given access to the planetarium at the [Lower East Side Girls Club](http://www.girlsclub.org/).

This sketch is inspired by the [Aurora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)). A ribbon of light wraps around the theater and dances to the music (using FFT data). As the song progresses, constellations from the northern hemisphere slowly reveal themselves. 

###Documentation

Here are some long exposure photos taken at the planetarium:

This is a screenshot of the simple shader test (found in FisheyeShaderTest). It's designed to the app content to the contours of the dome. I didn't end up using this code for my final work, but it may be useful to someone else.
